# DateCalculator


You can test the application by running the unit tests. The test cases match those provided in the outline. 



Things to fix:
 - Proper validation when creating a holiday if the supplied date is not valid (eg 31st september). Error should be logged and exception handled gracefully.
 - More Unit tests around the Occurence holidays could be useful.
 - Occurence holioday logic is a bit messy and could probably benefit from being split up.
